                <h3>History of Traditional Rice</h3>
                <p>
                    Traditional rice varieties have been cultivated for over 10,000 years, beginning with early farming communities in Asia.
                    In India, rice is not just a food—it is a cultural heritage deeply rooted in tradition, festivals, and daily life.
                    In ancient kingdoms, food was treated as medicine, strength, and culture, not just taste.
                    Kings followed disciplined food habits based on tradition and science.
                    <br><br>
                    • Only native grains and traditional rice like Kattuyanam, Mapillai Samba, Karuppu Kavuni were used<br>
                    • Foods were chosen according to season, climate, and body strength
                    <br><br>
                    For kings, traditional food was the source of power, health, and longevity.

                <h3>Why We Should Consume Traditional Rice?</h3>
                <p>
                    Traditional rice offers a natural solution rooted in our heritage.
                    Traditional rice is rich in fiber, minerals, antioxidants, and natural energy, unlike polished white rice.
                    Grown using native seeds and natural farming, free from harmful chemicals.
                    Keeps you full longer, prevents sugar spikes, and improves stamina.

            <h3>History of Millets</h3>
            <p>
                Millets are among the oldest cultivated grains in the world, grown for more than 7,000–10,000 years.
                They were cultivated in India, Africa, and China and mentioned in Vedic texts and Sangam literature.
                Consumed by kings, warriors, sages, and villagers for strength, stamina, and endurance.
                Declined after the Green Revolution and revived today for diabetes control, weight management, and sustainable living.
